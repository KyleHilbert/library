    When plus button is hit bring up a form to add a new book with
    the details of the book
    Form needs: 
      - Author
      - Title
      - Number of pages
      - If you have read it 


All of your book objects are going to be stored in a simple array, 
so add a function to the script (not the constructor) that can take 
userâ€™s input and store the new book objects into an array.
